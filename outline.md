## Why a child theme?

* Building a child theme will introduce us to key WordPress development characteristics without having to deal with all the intracacies that go along with developing from scratch. Think of it as "developing with a net."
* Certain popular frameworks operate under a child theme model; you purchase the theme framework and build child themes to operate on top of them.
* It's a digestable task for a two hour class.
