## Introduction

This repository contains materials and instructions related to the "[Building a Child Theme for WordPress](https://generalassemb.ly/education/building-a-child-theme-for-wordpress/washington-dc/12231)" class I will be teaching at [General Assembly DC](http://generalassemb.ly) on April 23, 2015.

## Purpose of This Class

This class is intended to expose front-end and full-stack web developers to the world of developing for WordPress. By creating our own child theme, we will learn about the WordPress template hierarchy, the WordPress Loop, common template tags, and more. We will see how front-end and back-end code work together to generate the beautiful themes available for WordPress-driven sites.

By some estimates, WordPress powers 23% of the Internet. As such, WordPress developers are in high demand in the job market. This class will give developers who've never worked on WordPress before a taste of what developing for it is like. For a deeper dive into WordPress development, check out my two-day General Assembly bootcamp coming in June (details to come).

## Prerequisites

This is not a class for beginners. Knowledge of front-end technologies (HTML and CSS) is required. Ideally, students will have had some experience using WordPress as a blogging or CMS platform, however we will work through the installation process together. Students will be required to bring a laptop capable of running a LAMP-compatible stack (Linux, apache, MySQL and PHP) and a text editor such as Sublime Text or Notepad++.

## Downloads

It will save time in class if you download the following files before attending:

* [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), or have a comparable LAMP-stack available that you know how to work with
* [The latest version of WordPress](https://wordpress.org/latest.zip)
* [This GitHub repository](https://github.com/taupecat/ga-wordpress-class/archive/master.zip)
* [The WordPress Theme Unit Test](https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/demo/theme-unit-test-data.xml)
